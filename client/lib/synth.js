/* :: NEW PROTOTYPE :: WORK IN PROGRESS :: 19/06/2014 */

/* Conjecture: the prototype does not follow the new architecture,
                because it does not implement RX, RQ, etc, in terms of
                    the micro-language recognized by the Interpreter;
            
                  this to save time in getting contributors up to speed ?
                
                possibly we can write a next version of this prototype that
                    re-implements the basics stuff in here in *in that new way*,
                        so we can get the feel for the new architecture together.. 
*/

/* Purpose: The prototype should illustrate how the Synth processes a simple task */
/* Purpose: The prototype should function as a demo for non-technical users */
