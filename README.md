Welcome to the AI Now JS Prototype!

To get you started understanding how the AI Now system works, or _will work_, we have created this codebase.

1) Try out the demo app here: [:: CURRENTLY OFFLINE ::](https://ainow-v7-proto-c9-ainow.c9.io), or clone the repo and run the server.js node-script.

2) Read the client/lib/synth.js file

3) Browse through the rest of the code in client/lib/*

We hope you will
